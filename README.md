# ⚙️ AI Resident – Model Training, Tuning & Inference at the Edge  
Summer resident role focused on accelerating deep learning model training, tuning, and inference 

**Location:** Brooklyn, NYC or Remote  
**Duration:** June–September 2025 (flexible)  
**Eligibility:** Senior undergrad, Master’s, or PhD students  

---

## 🚀 About the Role  
Join us to accelerate AI where it matters—on real hardware, under real constraints. This summer resident role spans the full lifecycle: training, tuning, and deploying models in environments where speed and precision are non-negotiable. You’ll help build intelligent systems that operate across GPU clusters, embedded devices, and latency-critical networks.

---

## 🔧 What You’ll Do  
- Train and fine-tune deep learning models for high-performance use cases  
- Optimize inference pipelines using TensorRT, ONNX, Triton, and TVM  
- Benchmark and adapt models across GPU, CPU, and embedded targets
- Use C++ and CUDA to wire models into real-time, protocol-level systems  
- Explore GNNs, transformers, and LSTMs for applications in finance, networking, or edge coordination  

---

## 🧠 What You Bring  
- Solid experience with PyTorch, CUDA, and systems-level engineering  
- Knowledge of GNNs, LSTMs, or transformer architectures  
- Experience working on AI performance across multiple hardware environments  
- Strong C++ and an interest in building AI systems that are production-ready and fast  

---

## ✳️ Bonus  
- Built AI systems for edge use (robotics, mobile, IoT) or high-frequency pipelines (finance, ops)  
- Familiarity with embedded AI stacks (OpenVINO, TF Lite, etc.)  
- Personal projects or research with an emphasis on speed, precision, or deployment under constraint
